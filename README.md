# Loan-Calculator
Here is a possible English translation and description of a GitHub repository by Winser Espinal:

"Create an application that works as a loan calculator. It should have a form where the user enters the loan amount, number of installments, and interest percentage, and generates the amortization table for the loan (using the French amortization method). Use the calculator from the RD Banking Superintendence as a reference.

Formula:
C = installment amount
V = loan amount
N = number of installments
i = monthly interest (annual interest / 12) / 100
C = ((V * i) / (1 - (1 + i) ** (-N)))

This repository contains the source code for a loan calculator application, developed by Winser Espinal. The application allows users to easily calculate the installment amounts for a loan based on the entered loan amount, number of installments, and interest percentage. The amortization table is generated using the French method, and the calculator is based on the one provided by the RD Banking Superintendence. The repository includes all the necessary files and instructions for running the application."
